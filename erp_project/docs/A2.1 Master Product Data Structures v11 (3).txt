Pluviago ERP Document A2.1 – Master Product Data Structures
Version 1.6 | July 2025 (Traceability-Integrated Update + QA Separation)

🌟 Purpose
To define a clear, normalized data structure across suppliers, products, items, batches, and storage. This version integrates derived logic for traceability and QA enforcement using the central Traceability Glossary and removes QA verification tracking from Item Records.

🧱 Master Data Table Relationships
Supplier → Product → Product Version → Item Record → Batch → Storage → Location
                                ↘        ↘
                                 Supplier-Product → QA Review Table
· Item Records contain derived fields that control traceability logic and QA triggers.
· Supplier-Product table manages batch code quality and vendor-specific formats.
· QA Review Table tracks actual verification activity per document.

🎓 Appendix: Glossary (Excerpt)
· Storage Zone: Macro-level area like RM Store or QA Hold
· Storage Location: Exact shelf/bin (e.g., QA-Shelf-3)
· QA Status: Final QA disposition for a batch/unit
· COA: Certificate of Analysis
· SDS: Safety Data Sheet
· Used In: Batch or experiment ID consuming this item
· Traceability Level: Defines the depth at which movement and usage is tracked (e.g., Unit-level, Batch-level, Category-level)
· SpecMatch: Indicates whether the observed material matches the product specification defined in the product master
· SerialNumber: Unique identifier assigned to an equipment or instrument
· CalibrationDate: Last calibration date recorded for compliant operation
· MaintenanceDueDate: Next scheduled maintenance to avoid downtime
· PhysicalLocation: Real-world fixed place of storage for instruments

Examples
📘 Format Key Definitions
These keys are used in structured ID fields like Item Record ID and SKU:
· CAT = Category Code (e.g., CHE = Chemical, BIO = Biological)
· USG = Usage Type Code (e.g., RM = Raw Material, FP = Finished Product)
· CODE = Short Item Code (e.g., CA = Calcium, ASTX = Astaxanthin)
· xxx = Placeholder for 2–5 character unique code or product short name
Example:
· CHE-RM-CA-001 → Chemical Raw Material, Calcium
· BIO-FP-ASTX-5-v1.0 → Biological Finished Product, Astaxanthin 5%, version 1.0

🔍 Batch Breakdown
ComponentMeaningExampleSourceBATCHFixed prefixBATCHAuto-fixedBIO-FP-OMEGA3ItemCodeProduct short code (from A2.1)A2.1 Item Masterv1Product formulation versionv1 = version 1Product Version Table20240720Batch start dateYYYYMMDDProduction PlanBS2401Batch Sequence = BS + YY (year) + NN (batch #)BS2401 = first batch in 2024Batch Master Table (increment logic per year+item)🧩 Integration Clarity Using A4 Structure
From A4, this relationship is crucial and should be noted clearly in A2.3 documentation:
Item Master (A2.1) → SKU → Batch Number → QA Review → Transaction Record (A2.3)
Examples:
· SKU = BIO-FP-ASTX-5-v1.0
· Batch Number = BIO-FP-ASTX-5-v1.0-20240612-01
· QAReviewID = QA-20240613-007
· TransactionID = TXN-20240614-003
:
· Supplier Example: SUP123 — Algamo S.R.O., Czech Republic
· Product Example: ASTX-5 — Astaxanthin 5% Softgel
· Version Example: ASTX-5-v1.0 — 5% Astaxanthin, Approved: 2023-01-01
· Item Example: BIO-FP-ASTX-5-v1.0 — Bottle of 60 capsules, Ambient, 24 months
· Batch Example: ASTX-V1.2-20240612-01 — 1000 bottles, Passed QA
· Storage Example: STG001 — 200 bottles stored at LOC001 (Main Warehouse)




Section E: Traceability Governance, Implementation Practices & Future Extensions
This A2.1 schema is designed for long-term adaptability, ensuring Pluviago’s traceability logic scales ethically and modularly across operations
E.1 – System Governance Notes
· All derived fields follow rules in the Traceability QA Glossary (v1.0).
· Item records with Traceability Level = None or Basic:
o Do not require batch code tracking or supplier traceability fields.
· Supplier-Product table manages traceability enablers (e.g., known batch format, spec presence), not logic.
· QA verification activities (COA/SDS/spec review) are not tracked inside Item Record.
o They are logged in the QA Review Table.
· The Traceability Level field controls system-required QA steps:
o None = minimal QA and supplier oversight.
o Basic = manual QA + flagged supplier.
o Batch-level = incoming batch documents required.
o Full = all documents required + validated.
· Use this document as the master schema for traceability-driven QA setup.
· Ensure ERP validation scripts, onboarding processes, and DC-1 transaction fields conform to this structure.
· Hazard Class is imported from the SDS (e.g., Acute Toxicity, Flammable Liquid).
· Hazard Category and Chemical Family are selected from the Chemical MDM Standard (DC-9).
· Together, these determine QA needs, storage location compatibility, and inventory segregation logic for chemical items.
·
·


📌 E.2 Implementation Recommendations
These guidelines ensure consistent, valid, and traceable master data across modules.
· Every new item must have a valid Item Record in this A2.1 file
· SKU codes must be used only for finished biological products and must link to Product and Version IDs
· Maintain full batch-level detail including expiry date, manufacturing origin, and storage condition
· The QA Required? flag should match the item’s grade and intended use
· The Hazard Class field must be completed for all chemical items
· Storage compatibility must be checked before assigning to warehouse zones
· Batch fields such as Batch Source and Batch Type must be filled for traceability
· Use consistent naming and formatting rules across tables
· Use this document as a living master register and update during onboarding or change events	
· For Category = Chemical, the fields Hazard Category and Chemical Family must be completed.
·  Storage zone and segregation rules are triggered based on these values.
· Hazard Class (from SDS), Hazard Category (from DC-9), and Chemical Family work together to define handling and QA flags.
· All dropdown values are enforced via DC-9 integration and reviewed quarterly.

📦 Factory Readiness & Transient States Modeling
This section ensures that A2.1 supports future internal production workflows, including harvesting, QA cycles, and internal traceability.
The model is designed to:
· Track stock transitions across states: Reserved, In-Transit, Pending Acceptance, etc.
· Support internal batch creation and scheduling (e.g., harvest, reactor runs)
· Record internal QA flows, product holds, and results from labs
· Handle mixed inventory: both externally purchased and internally produced items
· Model status flags and placeholders for future ERP automation

System logic has been structured to:
· Track item/batch status across each handover point in the value stream
· Accommodate production run linkage (e.g., PRN- codes)
· Enable dispatch, quarantine, and rejection handling without schema rewrites
These readiness layers are passive but extendable, ensuring A2.1 evolves with Pluviago’s future factory capabilities.
This section ensures the module aligns with both current traceability needs and future algae production workflows. Transient states such as Reserved, In-Transit, and Pending Acceptance are explicitly modeled in all documents.

For factory readiness, this module:
· Accommodates internal batch creation and scheduling (P15–P21).
· Supports internal QA flows and harvest recording.
· Ensures that status flows remain flexible and upgradeable without schema rewrites.
ERP logic and data schemas have been updated to:
· Track status of stock at every handover point.
· Include internal bioreactor runs, QA, and storage logic as placeholders (even if inactive).
· Allow reservation and dispatch fields to handle both external and internal use cases.
· Every SKU must have an Item Record before use
· SKUs must link to Product + Version IDs
· QA Required? flag must match grade + use case
· Hazard Class must be present for all chemicals
· Storage compatibility must be ERP-enforced
· Batch Source and Batch Type must be recorded for all batch entries
· Versioned? flag should guide when to maintain Product Versions
This document serves as a living master register for all product-related data and should be reviewed during every new item onboarding or vendor change.
